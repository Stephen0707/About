## About me
I am a senior at the University Of Washington studying Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Embedded   
Systems. My coursework and internships have allowed me to develop my skills in many languages such as Java, 
Python, Verilog, and C.

## Work experience

- During my freshman year, I worked as a Web Development/Business Intern at CIE (Chinese institute of engineers),
working on their website (https://www.cie-sea.org) and organizing stem-related competitions.
